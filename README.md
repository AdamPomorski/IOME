# IOME
IOME is a project that was created as a part of engineer paper on Warsaw University of Technology on Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology. The name stands for <i>pl. Interaktywny Odtwarzacz Multimedialny EEG</i> which stands is Interactive Media Player Controlled by Brain Waves Using EEG. Below there is a short recap of this paper work and visual representation of designed views in mobile application.

## Abstract
This project focuses on developing a system for subconscious mind training using the reward mechanism of music. This is implemented by creating a mobile application with a music player interface controlled by neural oscillation from EEG headband. The solution is based on the integration of continuously collected measurements from the EEG headband with the audio player from the Spotify mobile app. The user is allowed to choose his or her own favourite songs, when the application is designed to control the playback volume to keep the user as focused or relaxed as possible, depending on the application’s selected mode. In addition, saving and displaying the collected measurements in various graphical configurations has been implemented. The paper includes a theoretical description of the problem and an overview of solutions available on the market. The technologies used to create the system are also described, along with their implementation in the mobile application. The paper also includes a description of tests conducted on users.

### Introduction
In today's world, more people focus on self-development, encompassing both physical and mental aspects. To develop the mind, it must be trained similarly to other body parts. This can be achieved through systematic learning and cognitive skills development. However, effectively training the brain to enhance concentration and relaxation to improve mental comfort poses a challenge.

The goal of this project is to create a solution for subconscious brain training using a reward mechanism, which is music. This is achieved by integrating an EEG headband that measures brain waves with the audio player of the Spotify mobile application. By continuously collecting measurements, it is possible to control the audio player in a way that the music being listened to optimally affects the user's concentration or relaxation. Additionally, an important aspect is providing the user with maximum freedom in selecting the music tracks they want to listen to while also receiving feedback on how the music impacts their mind.

### Literature Review
The project focuses on studying human brain wave activity. These waves are electrical oscillations generated by neuronal activity in the brain, representing synchronization and communication between different brain regions. The technique used to measure brain waves is electroencephalography (EEG), a non-invasive method that measures the brain's bioelectricity using electrodes placed on the scalp. EEG devices, such as headbands, are widely used in medicine, particularly in diagnosing and treating conditions like epilepsy.

Several types of EEG measurement devices with wireless communication were compared, and the MyndBand headband by Neurosky was chosen for its low cost, quality, and developer tool availability. The project also reviews mobile applications that use brain wave readings to control audio players, focusing on both general and device-specific applications. Spotify was chosen as the music provider due to its popularity and developer tool availability.

### Design and Implementation
The developed mobile application for Android aims to improve user concentration or relaxation based on EEG measurements. Decisions are made regarding playback volume control, with the application relying on the Spotify mobile application for media playback. The application provides a user interface for controlling music playback and viewing real-time EEG readings.

Key features include:
- Volume control to maximize measured states,
- Rewarding users for better or maintained high scores,
- Reviewing tracks that best enhance focus or relaxation,
- Viewing individual results over time,
- Selecting the reward method for achieved results.

The application communicates with the MyndBand headband via Bluetooth to receive brain wave measurements. These raw measurements are processed by Neurosky's eSense algorithms for focus and meditation, resulting in scores from 0 to 100 that inform sound control decisions, stored in a local database. Users can switch between focus and meditation modes, which correspond to the eSense algorithms, with additional features like a timer in meditation mode.

The application also communicates with external services such as Spotify Web API for track information and playback queue management, Firebase Authentication for user authentication, and Firebase Realtime Database for storing measurement averages per song. Music playback control is managed via the Spotify Android SDK.

### Testing
User tests were conducted on a group of four volunteers aged 22 to 71, evaluating reactions to imposed tracks versus user-chosen tracks. Users worked on a computer while listening to music through headphones and wearing the MyndBand headband for brain wave measurements. The application, running in focus mode, collected measurements every second and analyzed them every five seconds to decide on volume changes. All users used volume increase as a reward for their performance.

Results indicated higher concentration with imposed tracks, confirmed by user feedback reporting greater distraction with their own music choices. The sound control mechanism worked as intended, and users expressed satisfaction with the system. Though limited in participant number, the tests suggest the system's short-term effectiveness, highlighting the need for further research and improvements, especially for long-term use and equipment comfort.

### Conclusions and Future Work
The project's goal of creating an application for subconscious mind training using an EEG headband and music player was achieved. The application integrates EEG measurements with Spotify, allowing mind training through sound control. Users can access collected data correlated with the music listened to. However, the lack of long-term and larger-scale user tests prevents a thorough evaluation of the sound control algorithm's efficacy.

Future development possibilities include collaboration with Spotify to integrate these features into their main application, improving the sound control algorithm, adding sleep-aiding functions, and conducting extensive tests. Additionally, the application could be used in Internet of Things projects, such as office concentration control systems or Smart Home integrations.
